    "Interpretation:\n",
    "Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (0.5043):\n",
    "The value of 0.5043 indicates a moderate positive monotonic relationship between the number of rooms and the property price. This means that as the number of rooms increases, the property price tends to increase as well, but not in a perfectly linear manner. There is some level of positive correlation, though it's not extremely strong.\n",
    "P-value (0.0):\n",
    "The p-value of 0.0 is very small, which suggests that the correlation is statistically significant. In other words, there is a very low probability that the observed correlation is due to random chance. You can confidently conclude that there is a meaningful relationship between the number of rooms and the property price in your data.\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "The moderate positive Spearman correlation (0.5043) suggests that as the number of rooms increases, property prices tend to increase, but not perfectly. The strong statistical significance (p-value = 0.0) indicates that this relationship is unlikely to be due to chance."
